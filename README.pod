=head1 DESCRIPTION

Date::Advent takes a Time::Piece date and calculates all four Sundays of Advent for the current Christian liturgical year.

As Advent is the beginning of the Christian liturgical calendar, this usually results in the date for Advent in the current year being dates in the past.  E.g. The Sundays of Advent returned for 12. March 2016 would be 29. November 2015, 6. December 2015, 13. December 2015, and 20. December 2015.
