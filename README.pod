=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Time::Piece;
    use Date::Advent;

    my $testAdvent = Date::Advent->new(date => Time::Piece->strptime("2016-01-01", "%Y-%m-%d"));
    say $testAdvent->firstSunday; #Gives date for first Sunday of Advent
    say $testAdvent->secondSunday; #Gives date for second Sunday of Advent
    say $testAdvent->thirdSunday; #Gives date for third Sunday of Advent
    say $testAdvent->fourthSunday; #Gives date for fourth Sunday of Advent
    say $testAdvent->christmas; #Gives date of Christmas

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Date::Advent takes a Time::Piece date and calculates all four Sundays of Advent for the current Christian liturgical year.

As Advent is the beginning of the Christian liturgical calendar, this usually results in the date for Advent in the current year being dates in the past.  E.g. The Sundays of Advent returned for 12. March 2016 would be 29. November 2015, 6. December 2015, 13. December 2015, and 20. December 2015.
